# Asset-Price-Forecasting-with-Options-Data

Will write more as I work along with this little project.

Options markets allow firms and people to make trades on volatility and asset price movements beyond the traditional tradeable equity. Based on the pricing of these derivatives, we can find aggregated implications on the price movements of the underlying assets.

By calculating implied probabilities of options expiring "at the money" or better, and combining these implied probabilities within a whole option chain, one could forecast price movements of the underlying assets based on market pricing of options.
